# ML-model-to-identify-people-with-Parkinson-s-Disease
An ML model using XGBoost algorithm based on Decision Trees that identifies a person having Parkinson's Disease and classifies it from a Heathy Person.

I used google collab to create the ML model

I got my traning and testing datasets from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/parkinsons

I was able to achieve an overall accuracy rate of 97%

Application: The model can be integrated to a website or application and can be used to successfully identify a person having Parkinson's Disease.

Future Work: I plan on to create another ML model for the same but that will use Gait Analysis and will be based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) Algorithm


P.S: I've uploaded the Datasets as well as the ipynb code file for the ML Model
